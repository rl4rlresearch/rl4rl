MECHANISM: Incremental positional common-mode quotient

HYPOTHESIS: Quotienting the uniform residual-channel direction of one additional late positional row will reduce the verified model from 1,618 to 1,617 parameters while retaining at least 99% accuracy, because the change is function-null and applies only one more optimization constraint.

INTENDED_EDIT: Extend positional compaction from the first two and final four rows to the first two and final five rows, preserving initialization and full-coordinate AdamW moments.

EVIDENCE: The current six-row positional quotient achieved 99.94% at 1,618 parameters; the reported 96.93% failure from further positional compression motivates testing the smallest possible one-row extension rather than compressing many additional rows simultaneously.
