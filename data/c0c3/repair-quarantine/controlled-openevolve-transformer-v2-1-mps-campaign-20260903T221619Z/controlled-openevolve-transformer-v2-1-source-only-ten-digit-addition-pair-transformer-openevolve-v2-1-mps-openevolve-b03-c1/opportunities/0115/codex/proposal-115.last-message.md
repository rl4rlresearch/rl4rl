MECHANISM: Tenth cross-head far-distance bias tie

HYPOTHESIS: Sharing the twenty-third-farthest relative-attention bias across both heads will reduce the verified model from 606 to 605 learned parameters while retaining at least 99% accuracy, given the current 99.89% result and nine successful adjacent far-distance ties.

INTENDED_EDIT: Remove the final two-value column from the head-specific relative-bias core and reconstruct it as one zero-initialized scalar shared by both heads.

EVIDENCE: The 606-parameter design achieved 99.89% accuracy, and sharing the nine immediately farther bias distances retained at least 99%; previous attempts at this boundary were unverifiable and therefore did not test its accuracy impact.
