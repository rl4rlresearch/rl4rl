MECHANISM: Tenth cross-head far-distance bias tie

HYPOTHESIS: Sharing the twenty-third-farthest relative-attention bias across both heads will reduce the verified model from 606 to 605 parameters while retaining at least 99% accuracy.

INTENDED_EDIT: Shorten the head-specific relative-bias table by one column and reconstruct that column from a zero-initialized shared scalar while preserving the full table length.

EVIDENCE: The 606-parameter model achieved 99.89% accuracy, and sharing each of the nine adjacent farther-distance biases through the twenty-second-farthest distance retained at least 99%; prior attempts at this boundary were unverifiable and provide no contrary accuracy evidence.
