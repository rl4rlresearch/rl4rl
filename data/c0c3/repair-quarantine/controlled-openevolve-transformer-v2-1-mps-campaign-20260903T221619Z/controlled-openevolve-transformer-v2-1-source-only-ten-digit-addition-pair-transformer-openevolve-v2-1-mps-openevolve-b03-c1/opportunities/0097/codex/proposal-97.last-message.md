MECHANISM: Cross-head twenty-third-distance bias tying

HYPOTHESIS: Sharing the twenty-third-farthest relative-attention bias across both heads will reduce the model from 866 to 865 learned parameters while retaining at least 99% accuracy.

INTENDED_EDIT: Shorten the per-head relative-bias core by one distance and reconstruct the removed distance with one shared learned scalar.

EVIDENCE: The current 866-parameter model achieved 99.22% accuracy, and nine consecutive adjacent cross-head distance ties through the twenty-second-farthest distance previously preserved at least 99% accuracy.
