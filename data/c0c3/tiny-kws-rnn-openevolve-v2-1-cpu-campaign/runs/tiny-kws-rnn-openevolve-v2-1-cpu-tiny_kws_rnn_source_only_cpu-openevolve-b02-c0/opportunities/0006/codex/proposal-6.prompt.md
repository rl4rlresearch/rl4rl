# Improve a recurrent keyword spotter

You are an autonomous ML engineer improving a learned causal recurrent model
that classifies one-second speech recordings into eight spoken commands.

## Goal

Produce a model with at least 85% accuracy on the fixed speaker-disjoint public
validation split, then minimize exact dense inference MACs. Among equal-MAC
models, fewer executed recurrent steps wins; among exact MAC-and-step ties,
fewer learned parameters wins. Every verification starts from fresh random
initialization and presents exactly 50,000 training clips drawn from a protected
training-speaker split.

The protected frontend supplies batches shaped `[batch, 32, 20]`: 32 causal
time frames with 20 normalized log-mel bands. `train.py` owns the model,
optimizer, loss, temporal augmentation, batch size, gradient handling, and
schedule. Keep its five top-level function interfaces intact.

The model interface is deliberately recurrent and evaluator-driven:

- `initial_state(batch_size, device, dtype)` returns batch-first tensor state,
  or a tuple/list of batch-first tensor states;
- `recurrent_step(frame, state)` updates that state from one `[batch, 20]`
  frame;
- `classify(state)` returns `[batch, 8]` logits;
- optional `recurrent_sequence(frames, state)` may run a standard causal
  sequence module efficiently, but must be numerically equivalent to repeated
  `recurrent_step` calls;
- optional `frame_schedule(available_frames)` returns 2–64 unique increasing
  input-frame indices, allowing causal striding;
- optional `exit_mask(state, logits, step, total_steps)` returns one boolean per
  active example after the mandatory first two recurrent steps.

All learned matrix operations must use `nn.Linear`, the standard
`nn.RNN`/`nn.GRU`/`nn.LSTM` modules, or their corresponding cell modules. Their
exact executed MACs are counted with protected runtime hooks over the complete
validation set. Bidirectional recurrence is rejected. Direct matmul, functional linear,
convolutions, and manually created Parameters are rejected because they could
bypass that counter. Dense matrices receive no credit for zero weights; only
structural reductions reduce cost. Elementwise gates, nonlinearities,
normalization, and recurrence logic remain flexible.

The verifier requires a state updated across at least two causal steps, material
dependence of the next state on the prior state, logits that materially depend
on recurrent output, learned recurrent-path weight changes, no complete-input
classifier bypass, and complete accounting of every executed recurrent step.
Layer C uses recordings from speakers absent from both search training and
public validation.

Public feedback includes accuracy, cross-entropy, the exact lexicographic
`inference_cost`, total and recurrent MACs, recurrent-step summaries, parameters,
peak hidden elements, training exposure, and training time.

## Work boundaries

## Recent verification evidence

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: Processing the 16 odd-indexed frames will retain at least 85% validation accuracy while approximately halving recurrent MACs and executed recurrent steps from the 87.24%-accurate baseline.
change: Change the causal frame schedule from all 32 frames to every second frame, preserving the final frame.
mechanism: Uniform causal frame decimation
evidence_used: The current 128-unit GRU reaches 87.24% accuracy but spends 1,482,178,560 recurrent MACs across 32 steps per example, leaving a 2.24-point margin for temporal decimation.
result: did not meet the accuracy requirement
reported_values: {"batch_size": 128, "examples_processed": 50000, "inference_cost": 3869987642617489952, "maximum_recurrent_steps": 16, "mean_recurrent_steps": 16.0, "median_recurrent_steps": 16, "optimizer_steps": 397, "p95_recurrent_steps": 16, "parameters": 58672, "peak_hidden_elements": 131584, "recurrent_macs": 741089280, "recurrent_steps": 13040, "total_inference_macs": 741923840, "training_seconds": 73.47678979113698, "validation_accuracy": 0.8257668711656442, "validation_cross_entropy": 0.5140387599453604}

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: Processing 24 uniformly distributed frames will recover validation accuracy to at least 85% while reducing recurrent MACs and steps by 25% versus the 32-frame baseline.
change: Skip every fourth input frame while retaining the final frame, yielding 24 recurrent steps for the fixed 32-frame input.
mechanism: Three-of-four causal frame subsampling
evidence_used: The 32-step model achieved 87.24% accuracy, while aggressive 16-step decimation achieved 82.58%; testing the 24-step midpoint is the most informative next reduction.
result: did not meet the accuracy requirement
reported_values: {"batch_size": 128, "examples_processed": 50000, "inference_cost": 5802804867952463512, "maximum_recurrent_steps": 24, "mean_recurrent_steps": 24.0, "median_recurrent_steps": 24, "optimizer_steps": 397, "p95_recurrent_steps": 24, "parameters": 58672, "peak_hidden_elements": 131584, "recurrent_macs": 1111633920, "recurrent_steps": 19560, "total_inference_macs": 1112468480, "training_seconds": 89.96426475001499, "validation_accuracy": 0.8355828220858895, "validation_cross_entropy": 0.4546638910024444}

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: A 112-unit GRU processing all 32 frames will retain at least 85% validation accuracy while reducing recurrent MACs by about 22% versus the 128-unit baseline.
change: Reduce the GRU state, temporal summary, and classifier input width from 128 to 112 without temporal subsampling.
mechanism: Width-reduced full-resolution recurrence
evidence_used: The 128-unit, 32-step model achieved 87.24% accuracy, while reducing temporal coverage to 24 or 16 steps failed; preserving every frame while trimming recurrent width targets compute without discarding causal observations.
result: met the accuracy requirement and became an available design

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: A 104-unit GRU processing all 32 frames will retain at least 85% validation accuracy while reducing recurrent MACs by approximately 13% versus the verified 112-unit model.
change: Reduce the GRU hidden state, temporal summary, and classifier input width from 112 to 104 while preserving full causal temporal resolution and the existing training procedure.
mechanism: Incremental recurrent-width reduction
evidence_used: The 112-unit full-resolution GRU achieved 86.13% accuracy, whereas reducing temporal coverage failed at both 24 and 16 steps; this motivates preserving all 32 frames and testing a conservative 8-unit width reduction.
result: met the accuracy requirement and became an available design
reported_values: {"batch_size": 128, "examples_processed": 50000, "inference_cost": 5266546035573746592, "maximum_recurrent_steps": 32, "mean_recurrent_steps": 32.0, "median_recurrent_steps": 32, "optimizer_steps": 397, "p95_recurrent_steps": 32, "parameters": 40192, "peak_hidden_elements": 107008, "recurrent_macs": 1008983040, "recurrent_steps": 26080, "total_inference_macs": 1009661120, "training_seconds": 112.49923920817673, "validation_accuracy": 0.8588957055214724, "validation_cross_entropy": 0.4562299014600508}

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: A 96-unit GRU processing all 32 frames will retain at least 85% validation accuracy while reducing recurrent MACs by roughly 14% versus the verified 104-unit model.
change: Reduce the GRU hidden state and classifier input width from 104 to 96 while preserving all frames and the existing training procedure.
mechanism: Incremental full-resolution GRU width reduction
evidence_used: Reducing width from 112 to 104 lowered accuracy by only 0.25 percentage points, from 86.13% to 85.89%, while reducing recurrent MACs from 1,156,700,160 to 1,008,983,040; this supports testing the next conservative eight-unit reduction without discarding temporal information.
result: did not meet the accuracy requirement

Use the available technical evidence to choose the most informative next
change. Treat unsuccessful or malformed work as evidence when a useful
subject-level reason is provided. Do not invent missing evidence.

## Response

Return these short metadata lines followed by one or more exact
`SEARCH`/`REPLACE` blocks that together produce one implementation:

`MECHANISM: <a concise free-form name for the computational idea>`

`HYPOTHESIS: <a falsifiable claim grounded in the evidence above>`

`INTENDED_EDIT: <what this patch changes>`

`EVIDENCE: <the most relevant prior result and why it motivates this patch>`

Start each block with `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, put the exact existing lines next, use a
line containing `=======` as the divider, put the replacement lines after it,
and finish the block with `>>>>>>> REPLACE`.

Every `SEARCH` section must be nonempty and match exactly once after earlier
blocks have been applied. All blocks must apply. Together they must describe
one implementation ready for verification. The mechanism name is descriptive,
not chosen from a fixed list. Do not paste whole files, lengthy logs, or routine
progress reports outside the patch.
