# Improve a recurrent keyword spotter

You are an autonomous ML engineer improving a learned causal recurrent model
that classifies one-second speech recordings into eight spoken commands.

## Goal

Produce a model with at least 85% accuracy on the fixed speaker-disjoint public
validation split, then minimize exact dense inference MACs. Among equal-MAC
models, fewer executed recurrent steps wins; among exact MAC-and-step ties,
fewer learned parameters wins. Every verification starts from fresh random
initialization and presents exactly 50,000 training clips drawn from a protected
training-speaker split.

The protected frontend supplies batches shaped `[batch, 32, 20]`: 32 causal
time frames with 20 normalized log-mel bands. `train.py` owns the model,
optimizer, loss, temporal augmentation, batch size, gradient handling, and
schedule. Keep its five top-level function interfaces intact.

The model interface is deliberately recurrent and evaluator-driven:

- `initial_state(batch_size, device, dtype)` returns batch-first tensor state,
  or a tuple/list of batch-first tensor states;
- `recurrent_step(frame, state)` updates that state from one `[batch, 20]`
  frame;
- `classify(state)` returns `[batch, 8]` logits;
- optional `recurrent_sequence(frames, state)` may run a standard causal
  sequence module efficiently, but must be numerically equivalent to repeated
  `recurrent_step` calls;
- optional `frame_schedule(available_frames)` returns 2–64 unique increasing
  input-frame indices, allowing causal striding;
- optional `exit_mask(state, logits, step, total_steps)` returns one boolean per
  active example after the mandatory first two recurrent steps.

All learned matrix operations must use `nn.Linear`, the standard
`nn.RNN`/`nn.GRU`/`nn.LSTM` modules, or their corresponding cell modules. Their
exact executed MACs are counted with protected runtime hooks over the complete
validation set. Bidirectional recurrence is rejected. Direct matmul, functional linear,
convolutions, and manually created Parameters are rejected because they could
bypass that counter. Dense matrices receive no credit for zero weights; only
structural reductions reduce cost. Elementwise gates, nonlinearities,
normalization, and recurrence logic remain flexible.

The verifier requires a state updated across at least two causal steps, material
dependence of the next state on the prior state, logits that materially depend
on recurrent output, learned recurrent-path weight changes, no complete-input
classifier bypass, and complete accounting of every executed recurrent step.
Layer C uses recordings from speakers absent from both search training and
public validation.

Public feedback includes accuracy, cross-entropy, the exact lexicographic
`inference_cost`, total and recurrent MACs, recurrent-step summaries, parameters,
peak hidden elements, training exposure, and training time.

## Work boundaries

Minimize inference_cost. Required result: validation_accuracy >= 0.85.
Editable source files: train.py.
Results reported after each verification: validation_accuracy, validation_cross_entropy, inference_cost, total_inference_macs, recurrent_macs, recurrent_steps, mean_recurrent_steps, median_recurrent_steps, p95_recurrent_steps, maximum_recurrent_steps, parameters, peak_hidden_elements, examples_processed, optimizer_steps, training_seconds, batch_size.

Propose changes through exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. The patching interface applies them to the supplied editable source.

The editable source and any reference source are included below. Do not access
parent directories, home directories, shared temporary directories, global
session history, online sources, external datasets, pretrained weights, or any
surrounding repository. Do not run training or validation yourself and do not
generate hidden alternatives. Return one patch for one implementation;
verification happens after you finish.

## Recent verification evidence

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: Processing 16 evenly spaced frames with the unchanged 128-unit GRU will retain at least 85% accuracy while nearly halving total inference MACs and reducing recurrent steps from 32 to 16.
change: Select the second frame of each adjacent frame pair, preserving uniform coverage and the final input frame.
mechanism: Uniform causal frame decimation
evidence_used: The current model reaches 87.24% accuracy at 32 steps and 1.483B MACs, providing 2.24 percentage points of margin for a controlled 2× temporal reduction.
result: did not meet the accuracy requirement

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: Processing 24 uniformly distributed frames with the unchanged 128-unit GRU will recover at least 85% validation accuracy while reducing recurrent steps and recurrent MACs by 25% versus the qualified 32-frame design.
change: Keep three frames from every four, including the first and final frames, using a schedule that is a strict superset of the unsuccessful 16-frame odd-index schedule.
mechanism: Nested three-of-four causal frame sampling
evidence_used: The 32-frame model achieved 87.24% accuracy, while uniform 16-frame decimation achieved 82.58%; testing the 24-frame midpoint directly brackets the temporal-compute threshold while restoring eight evenly distributed observations.
result: did not meet the accuracy requirement

RECENT RESULT
hypothesis: A 96-unit GRU processing all 32 frames will retain at least 85% validation accuracy while reducing recurrent MACs by approximately 41% versus the qualified 128-unit design.
change: Reduce the GRU hidden width, recurrent state, temporal summary, and classifier input from 128 to 96 while preserving the full causal frame schedule.
mechanism: Full-resolution recurrent width reduction
evidence_used: Temporal subsampling to 16 and 24 steps failed at 82.58% and 83.44%, showing that full temporal coverage is important; the qualified 32-step model has 87.24% accuracy, providing margin to test structural width reduction instead.

## Response

Return these short metadata lines followed by one or more exact
`SEARCH`/`REPLACE` blocks that together produce one implementation:

`MECHANISM: <a concise free-form name for the computational idea>`

`HYPOTHESIS: <a falsifiable claim grounded in the evidence above>`

`INTENDED_EDIT: <what this patch changes>`

`EVIDENCE: <the most relevant prior result and why it motivates this patch>`

Start each block with `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, put the exact existing lines next, use a
line containing `=======` as the divider, put the replacement lines after it,
and finish the block with `>>>>>>> REPLACE`.

Every `SEARCH` section must be nonempty and match exactly once after earlier
blocks have been applied. All blocks must apply. Together they must describe
one implementation ready for verification. The mechanism name is descriptive,
not chosen from a fixed list. Do not paste whole files, lengthy logs, or routine
progress reports outside the patch.
