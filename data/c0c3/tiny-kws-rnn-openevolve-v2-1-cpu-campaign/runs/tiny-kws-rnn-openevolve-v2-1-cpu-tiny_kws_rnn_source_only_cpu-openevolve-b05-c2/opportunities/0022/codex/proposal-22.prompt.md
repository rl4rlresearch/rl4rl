# Improve a recurrent keyword spotter

You are an autonomous ML engineer improving a learned causal recurrent model
that classifies one-second speech recordings into eight spoken commands.

## Goal

Produce a model with at least 85% accuracy on the fixed speaker-disjoint public
validation split, then minimize exact dense inference MACs. Among equal-MAC
models, fewer executed recurrent steps wins; among exact MAC-and-step ties,
fewer learned parameters wins. Every verification starts from fresh random
initialization and presents exactly 50,000 training clips drawn from a protected
training-speaker split.

The protected frontend supplies batches shaped `[batch, 32, 20]`: 32 causal
time frames with 20 normalized log-mel bands. `train.py` owns the model,
optimizer, loss, temporal augmentation, batch size, gradient handling, and
schedule. Keep its five top-level function interfaces intact.

The model interface is deliberately recurrent and evaluator-driven:

- `initial_state(batch_size, device, dtype)` returns batch-first tensor state,
  or a tuple/list of batch-first tensor states;
- `recurrent_step(frame, state)` updates that state from one `[batch, 20]`
  frame;
- `classify(state)` returns `[batch, 8]` logits;
- optional `recurrent_sequence(frames, state)` may run a standard causal
  sequence module efficiently, but must be numerically equivalent to repeated
  `recurrent_step` calls;
- optional `frame_schedule(available_frames)` returns 2–64 unique increasing
  input-frame indices, allowing causal striding;
- optional `exit_mask(state, logits, step, total_steps)` returns one boolean per
  active example after the mandatory first two recurrent steps.

All learned matrix operations must use `nn.Linear`, the standard
`nn.RNN`/`nn.GRU`/`nn.LSTM` modules, or their corresponding cell modules. Their
exact executed MACs are counted with protected runtime hooks over the complete
validation set. Bidirectional recurrence is rejected. Direct matmul, functional linear,
convolutions, and manually created Parameters are rejected because they could
bypass that counter. Dense matrices receive no credit for zero weights; only
structural reductions reduce cost. Elementwise gates, nonlinearities,
normalization, and recurrence logic remain flexible.

The verifier requires a state updated across at least two causal steps, material
dependence of the next state on the prior state, logits that materially depend
on recurrent output, learned recurrent-path weight changes, no complete-input
classifier bypass, and complete accounting of every executed recurrent step.
Layer C uses recordings from speakers absent from both search training and
public validation.

Public feedback includes accuracy, cross-entropy, the exact lexicographic
`inference_cost`, total and recurrent MACs, recurrent-step summaries, parameters,
peak hidden elements, training exposure, and training time.

## Work boundaries

Minimize inference_cost. Required result: validation_accuracy >= 0.85.
Editable source files: train.py.
Results reported after each verification: validation_accuracy, validation_cross_entropy, inference_cost, total_inference_macs, recurrent_macs, recurrent_steps, mean_recurrent_steps, median_recurrent_steps, p95_recurrent_steps, maximum_recurrent_steps, parameters, peak_hidden_elements, examples_processed, optimizer_steps, training_seconds, batch_size.

Propose changes through exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. The patching interface applies them to the supplied editable source.

The editable source and any reference source are included below. Do not access
parent directories, home directories, shared temporary directories, global
session history, online sources, external datasets, pretrained weights, or any
surrounding repository. Do not run training or validation yourself and do not
generate hidden alternatives. Return one patch for one implementation;
verification happens after you finish.
