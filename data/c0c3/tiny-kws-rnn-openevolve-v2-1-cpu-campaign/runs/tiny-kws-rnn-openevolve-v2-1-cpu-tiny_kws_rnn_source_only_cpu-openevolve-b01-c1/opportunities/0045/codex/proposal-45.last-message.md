MECHANISM: Progressive upper-skip adjacent-band folding

HYPOTHESIS: Folding normalized upper-skip bands 4–5 will retain at least 85% validation accuracy because the lower GRU still receives all 19 spectral features, while reducing recurrent inference by exactly 3,286,080 MACs.

INTENDED_EDIT: Reduce the upper GRU input width from 61 to 60 and replace its six individual low-band skip features with four individual bands plus an average of bands 4–5 in both recurrent execution paths.

EVIDENCE: Six successive upper-skip reductions have met the accuracy requirement, and the latest fold of bands 6–7 achieved 85.28% while saving exactly 3,286,080 recurrent MACs; applying the same localized fold to the next adjacent pair is the most direct test of the compression boundary.
