MECHANISM: Cross-head twenty-third-distance bias tying

HYPOTHESIS: Sharing both heads’ twenty-third-farthest attention bias will reduce the model from 1,107 to 1,106 parameters while maintaining at least 99% accuracy.

INTENDED_EDIT: Shorten the head-specific relative-bias core by one distance, add one shared learned scalar, and insert it immediately before the existing twenty-second-distance scalar.

EVIDENCE: The adjacent twenty-second-distance tie achieved 99.91% accuracy with 1,107 parameters, while prior twenty-third-distance attempts yielded no negative accuracy result because they reproduced the old implementation or could not be verified.
