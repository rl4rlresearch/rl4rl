MECHANISM: Cross-head twenty-third-farthest relative-bias tying

HYPOTHESIS: Sharing the next adjacent relative-distance bias across both heads will reduce the model from 1,041 to 1,040 parameters while retaining at least 99% accuracy.

INTENDED_EDIT: Shorten the head-specific relative-bias core by one distance and add one learned scalar shared across both heads at that distance.

EVIDENCE: Nine consecutive adjacent cross-head bias ties through the twenty-second-farthest distance retained at least 99% accuracy; prior attempts at this next tie were unverifiable rather than accuracy failures, while more complex gauge removals repeatedly timed out.
