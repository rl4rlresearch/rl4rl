MECHANISM: Cross-head twenty-third-distance bias tying

HYPOTHESIS: Replacing the two head-specific biases at the twenty-third-farthest attention distance with one shared learned scalar will reduce the model from 1,107 to 1,106 parameters while maintaining at least 99% accuracy.

INTENDED_EDIT: Shorten the head-specific relative-bias core by one column, add a shared twenty-third-distance scalar, expand it across heads, and insert it before the existing twenty-second-distance bias.

EVIDENCE: The adjacent twenty-second-distance tie achieved 99.91% accuracy with 1,107 parameters, while prior twenty-third-distance submissions supplied no negative accuracy result because they reproduced the unchanged implementation or could not be verified.
